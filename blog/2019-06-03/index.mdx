I am starting my product management journey finally. In this blog post I cover the why and how of product management.

I worked as a developer/ project manager at a startup called PLAAK. PLAAK is a blockchain ecosystem based in Australia and offers a digital asset exchange for people to trade at low fees. Along with that it also has a digital assets wallet in form of a credit card with a e-ink display and a finger print scanner. Previous to this I had worked with a startup called Newbee Network and also did an internship as a UI Designer with another Indian based startup called SiteControl.

### Why product mangement all of a sudden?

1. Based on previous experiences I realised there was a big difference between the business goals and tech/design side. If I could somehow learn how to manage this gap carefully then I think I can make every product a success( or atleast tend to).

1. Beginning being a generalist and specializing in UX/UI and frontend tech I think I can help companies grow and scale. I actually love the end to end development of products. I can work closely to all stakeholders and ensure product success

### How will I go about learning PM?

Product management is a very wide field and there is no fixed way to do it. But there is a lifecycle that we must understand. 

#### 1. Understand the 10,000 ft overview
1. I started watching videos on youtube about SaaS products (as I really love the SaaS model)

#### 2. Understand detailed process

Here I picked up two resources, 


1. Udemy - Become a Product Manager  | Learn the Skills & Get the job [Link to Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-product-manager-learn-the-skills-get-a-job/ "Become a Product Manager on Udemy")
 
 Its a good 13 hour course which goes through generalised terms. Its pretty good for full stack devs wanting to step into PM (hence I enrolled)

1. Pirple SaaS Masterclass  [Link to Pirple The SaaS Masterclass](https://pirple.thinkific.com/courses/the-saas-master-class "Pirple The SaaS Master Class")

 Its an online-course like no other. Over 365 days, they teach us how to plan, build, launch and manage our own SaaS startup company.

#### Some amazing forumns to join-

1. [Indiehackers](https://www.indiehackers.com "Indiehackers.com")
2. [Producthunt](http://producthunt.co "producthunt.co")
