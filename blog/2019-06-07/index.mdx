Hi everyone. If you have followed my previous articles then we did find our customers and competitors in the last few days. I have combined the next 2 days of the SaaS Masterclass by Pirple as I had not much to do with the Day 4. Let's see what was there.


### Day 4 - Know the Laws 

Now we have already found our ideas, lets find out how we need to look at them from a legal perspective. Strictly speaking, the video had the following parts-


1. **Carry out legal research for all of our ideas**

1. **Look at some sectors which are to be avoided - alcohol, drugs, banking, etc**

1. **Find out how to setup our startup**

1. **Have a look at Stripe Atlas (For USA Only)**


As my ideas weren't from such industries I didnt really do much on the Day 4 and took a day off basically. Instead, I worked on the Day 2 & 3 tasks and improved my research.

Thats all for a short legal side of Day 04. Now to Day 05

### Day 5 - Make a Decision

Well, I have been trying to make a decision from day 1 itself. I figured out that the decision making is harder than I anticipated. The good thing that I learned so far is that the gut feeling is not wrong but it does improve and change as we do some analysis and research as we did in the Day 2 to Day 4.

So Day 5 assignment is simple- 'Prepare a Business Plan of the finalised idea'

The instructor suggests-

1. **Do not use any shady ideas**

1. **Do not use an idea which you cannot build alone**

  So my ideas are using AI- all of them. I know its a good idea but can I do it right now? No. I need to learn. The learning part is fine, but we need to decide that can we learn all it takes to build that idea and be certain it will be completed. Hence I drop a few of my ideas to not pressurize myself.

1. **Dont pickup a Banking, Alcohol or any other regulated industry idea**

  Well, that should make sense, shouldn't it? Licencing is a problem and they are very expensive. We are planning to do a few dollar startup.
